  - Defined clear component dependencies

### 2. Error Handling

- âœ… Consistent Error Handling
  - Created custom error types
  - Implemented error wrapping
  - Added error middleware for HTTP requests

### 3. Testing

- âœ… Unit Testing
  - Added tests for config package
  - Added tests for GDB service

### 5. Logging and Monitoring

- âœ… Structured Logging
  - Implemented zerolog for structured logging
  - Added log levels and formatting

## Improvements In Progress

### 4. Performance and Scalability

## Next Steps

1. Complete refactoring handlers to use the new error handling system
2. Update WebSocket hub to use the new configuration system
3. Implement remaining performance improvements
4. Add more unit and integration tests
5. Improve API consistency and documentation
6. Implement frontend improvements

## Challenges and Considerations

- The dependency injection system requires careful refactoring of existing components
- Error handling must be consistent across the entire codebase
- Testing should cover critical components first before expanding
